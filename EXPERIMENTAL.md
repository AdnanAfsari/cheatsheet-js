# Practical JavaScript notes

## Intro

* Through programming, you can work on three core life skills: logic, communication, and health (especially mental health).
* The Watch and Code approach has three distinct stages: beginning, middle, and late.
* The beginning stage is focused on teaching you the mechanics of programming from the computer's perspective.
* The middle stage helps you understand existing programs through methodically reading code.
* The late stage is where you'll contribute to a large existing software project. The objectives are to learn through independent action in a team environment.
* Try to set up a system where you code as often as possible (ideally every day). Focus your energy on being consistent. Don't worry about how much you get done on any given day. The goal is not to be the hero of a random day, week, or month, but to be a hero over the span of a long career.

## Language considerations

* There are four aspects that make a programming language good for learning. The language is ideally (1 easy to read), has a (2 compact syntax), is (3 easy to set up), and is (4 clearly useful).
* JavaScript does reasonably well in (1 easy to read), very poorly in (2 compact syntax). It does exceptionally well in the last two aspects (3 easy to set up) and (4 clearly useful).
* We can make JavaScript very nearly the perfect language for learning by teaching only the essential features of the language at the beginning. In doing so, we force the language to have a compact syntax. Later on, we can layer on the optional features of the language.

## Support

* Office hours on Mondays.
* If you continue beyond this intro course, you'll have access to a Slack group and daily Zoom meetings where you can get help. 

## Get ready

* Use Google Chrome and VS Code.
* Make sure that you set up VS Code *exactly* the way I do it.
* Don't worry about HTML and DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WASTE TIME MEMORIZING STUFF.
* Make sure you HTML file is structured exactly like mine too. If not, you will fail.
* The computer is a harsh taskmaster. Character level precision matters. If you can't get this right, you will fail.
* This is the easy part. Do not fail at the easy part.

## Todo lists are so f&ast;&ast;king lame. Or are they?

* You can learn more than you think from building a todo list.
* Almost every site is a todo list. There are exceptions, but not many.
* Our todo list is gonna be ugly because we are purposely ignoring visual style.

## V1 - Getting started

* Arrays are lists: `['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']`.
* Variables are nicknames for data: `var todos = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']`.
* Semicolons act sort of like periods do in English. They don't appear at the end of every line though.
* Proper semicolon usage is particularly important when you are saving to a file, so pay close attention to how I use semicolons in `todoList.html`. I'll note exceptions as we get to them.
* You can ignore my semicolon usage in the console since I treat that environment like a temporary scratchpad/whiteboard.
* Use `console.log` to display data in the console. Example: `console.log('hi hi hi!')`.
* Computers start counting from 0, not 1.
* On an array, use `.push` to add data to the end of the array. Example: `myArray.push('new data')`.
* Get an element at a certain position: `array[position]`.
* Change an element at a certain position: `array[position] = 'changed!`.
* Remove an element at a certain position: `array.splice(position, 1)`.
